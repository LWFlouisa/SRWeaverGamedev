      <h1>Ehena's Silent Lunch</h1>
<ol>
<li>Ehena-Marie, girlfriend of Hemato-Tomato, moved to the US from France with her
father, leaving behind her sisters whom are grown adults by this point.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The fact that she is only half French is a source of anxiety and self-esteem
issues, compounding by her lack of fluency in Japanese despite her mom being
Japanese.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She introduces herself to the class by speaking in her native French. She
presents a brave facade despite being an emotional wreck, but at this point we
don't know her troubles.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>Ehena's father is extremely traditional, almost to a fault. While other students
could wear largely what they wanted, she was stuck having to be created with how
she wore 1950s style dresses, despite the fact that it was the year 2016, three
years before she was executed,</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Her father would mostly watch old western movies, and barely pay attention to
his daughter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Her father cares more about her mother than her, which is a source oc
self-esteem issues. This was before her visions and hallucinations began, if
they are hallucinations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>Ehena was not really sure whether her girlfriend liked her for her or her
footwear choices, as she was more the type of girl to wear Birkenstock boston
clogs and Steel Toe boots, while others in more formal occassions wearing saddle
shoes.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<ol start="4">
<li>Ehena describes herself as tall as a short male, which makes her somewhat taller
than most girls her age. This made it difficult to find clothes that properly
fit, especially in more traditional clothes like 1950s school uniforms.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<ol start="5">
<li>While she describes herself as a conformist, in truth she's closer to passive
aggressively counter-cultural. She takes on the appearance of conformity in
order to please her father, but when not have her real nature begins to surface.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<ol start="6">
<li>Her weapon of choice is Arsenic and Daggers, although in practice do to the
nature of her father's conservative house, this weirdly meant that a dagger was
more likely to not be detected in contrast with poison.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When she went to quarries with Hemato and her best guy friend, this meant that
she could only study how to get Arsenic when visiting a Hemato's best friend's
house.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Until one day when she decided that she no longer wanted her father in the
picture, but she had not yet decided she wanted to be rid of him altogether.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="7">
<li>In the school Hemato and Ehena went to, the school allowed for capital
punishment by guillotine for those whom broke silence rules during lunch time.
Although at first this is assumed to be a rumor, patially corroborated by the
fact that no student sent to the office has ever returned. By there is an
infamous room known as &quot;Salle De Mort&quot;, the halls of death.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This is where we find out that Ehena-Marie might not be the most reliable
narrator, as she describes students as being taken by security guards to the
Salle De Mort.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Silent lunch had been a gradual increase of strictness ever sense the French
take over of the United States after World War III. How much it based on the
actual stricrtness of the school staff or Ehena's poor reliability is not clear.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="8">
<li>Hemato-Tomato is aware of Ehena's feelings about her father, but opt to not
report her to the authority, whom have grown increasingly tyrannical in recent
months.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Technically Hemato-Tomato could have ratted her out at any point, and there are
indications she may know about the monster in which Ehena Marie sees in her
bedroom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hemato taunts Ehena by showing her the severed head of one of her female
classmates, which all but confirms that indeed students whom violent silent
lunch get the ultimate penalty: being beheaded by guillotine.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="9">
<li>At bedtime after her father has went to bed, she would see this bear-like
creature in her closet that came from hell, and had vampire like tendencies.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This bear-bat, the bear-bat of ghouls, acts as a grim repear to transfer souls
to the afterlife, with his henchmen being ursinepires.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An Ursinepiros is a vampire bear-like person whom came back from the dead to
have vengance on thos whom had killed them in battle during life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eventually she finds her that her sister had become one of these beasts, and she
had traveled to the US to see her sister for one last time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eventually the bear-bat offers to murder Ehena's father, in exchange for her
soul. Although this is uncertain what impact this would be given that
reincarnation is an esstablished thing in this universe.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h2>Eventually this culminates into her murdering her father, by slitting his throat
with one of her daggers, then locking him in a chest in her attic.</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>She woke up her bed with leaves in it, as if she had been previously out in the
midnight forest.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hemato eventually swears revenge against the government that executed the only
girl she had ever loved more than anyone else.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eventually she is arrested when a S.W.A.T team was sent to her house under
suspicions of comitting murder.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>These creatures take on a human like form in silhouette, except during thefull
moon when they change into this vampiric bear-like beast.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="10">
<li>It wasn't unheard for characters in sitcoms in this alternate history to be
wiped from official records, meaning that wasn't really a way to know for sure
whether a character actually existed. This caused cognitive dissonance when she
thought she remembered a grandma figure in a sitcome she used to watch.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Censorship in general had gotten more strict ever sense the French take over of
the United States.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This harsh censorship never totally left during the Franco-Japanese wars, that
eventually culminated in the partitioning of the US into Japanese states and
French states.</p>
</li>
</ul>
