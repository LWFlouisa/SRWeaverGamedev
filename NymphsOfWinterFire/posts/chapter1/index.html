      <h2>Chapter One Fina</h2>
<p>The apartment was dimly lit, with the cold wind breezing through the apartment. Bernina was cleaning the restrooms, and handed Fina the bucket to go dump it out. “We need to take out the pale?” Fina said, crouching down as if to complain about the task at hand. Though she knew she needed to do it, she did not want to deal with the moldy stink that was the bucket full of fecal matter. “Why should not Nina have to do it, she didn’t have to take it out last time.&quot;</p>
<p>“I’m leaving it to you,” Bernina hammered her cane onto the wooden floor. “remember if you don’t, then know-one else. That will will be more for you do later, wouldn’t it be? I learned it myself from my own mother many years ago, I’m a’ teaching you the same.” Fina was smart enough not to complain about the task her mother assigned her, as she walked outside of the door, then walked to the streets below. Carefully she aimed directly into the bin, so it would not land on the bum that sat besides dumpster below. Then wondered whether he would be cold. For a moment she wanted to go outside to put the coat over him, but thought better of it. She carried around a small clock locket, but wanted a pair of binoculars to match.</p>
<p>Over the past week it has been extremely flurry, and Fina wondered why her mother would want to go out into the city. When it wasn’t cold, it was usually wet. So every step they took in their wooden shoes was a slippery slope. “Do you know when we are going to leave?” Fina said, leaning back inside. Bernina turned around, checking to make sure Nina was ready.</p>
<p>“We will be gone for a while, ... both of you.” Bernina had a hard time keeping herself from leaning forward, and falling onto the floor. So she pressed more firmly her wooden cane on the floor leaving a small indention. “Remember to take your text-books with you. Just because it’s a trip, doesn’t relief you from having math work to do.”</p>
<p>It was a slow ride in the car. Snow flurried outside of the window. And one could see the city oil lamps pass in the distance, at the speed from their car making them merge together into a single loop. Fina was barely able to make out shapes as they passed by quickly, as she pressed her face against the window. Nina was sleeping. Bernina honked on the horn, at the slow moving car in front of her. “Remember what I said, you may need to read your math while I’m gone.” Then saw Nina’s favorite book sitting beside her lap. “You did not take one of your favorite novels did you?”</p>
<p>Nina’s giggle had a grating sound that reminded Bernina of scraping chalk boards.</p>
<p>After they arrived at the book shop, Bernina walked over and opened the door. Their mother stared down at them with her beady little eyes on her face covered in shadows. “I don’t trust you two to walk with me on your own. So now I’m going to hold both of your hands.”</p>
<p>In the book they walked further inside. Fina and Nina admired the books they could see. It was Nina who wanted to go look at the children’s books. “Nina, come back here.” said Bernina banged her cane on the floor. Fina stayed closely behind, while Bernina held onto their hand. “Can we look for books mommy.” Fina said, trying to quiet her mother’s anger.</p>
<p>Bernina turned around. “Sure, but remember to stay close.” Bernina slammed it onto the floor. “Especially you, you pesky theif.” Fina hopped, and held Nina by the hand as they ran to the shelf. “And no running either.”</p>
<p>Fina and Nina admired the books on the shelf. Fina picked one up, then carefully placed one back. She only stole a book once, never again. “Come on Nina, come with me.” Fina said. Nina jerked her wrist out of Fina’s hand.</p>
<p>Then started running outside. “Wait Nina, your going to be cold.” Then Fina went outside to go retrieve her.</p>
<p>It was simply a matter of luck that Fina did not alert Bernina. When she was outside, she quickly grabbed nanny back the back, and picked her up. “Come on, let’s go back inside.” They walked inside, and were greeted by the flushed face of their mother, whose hand was shaking with her long stick.</p>
<p>“Come on girls, let’s go.” She took her book, their wrists, then they all walked back to the car. “I can’t believe that you would disobey me like that.&quot; Simply staring her their mother's thin face with beady eyes was punishment enough to kill a white polar bear.</p>
<p>Day went, night came. They sat at the dinner table. Mom made for them all a quick dinner. Lucas -- their father, would not be home until late that evening. “Where is daddy,” Nina said, sticking her fork in her green peas staring at her mother’s cold tiny eyed stare.</p>
<p>“He won’t be home till late, I’m going to go read. Stay behind, and do the dishes.” Bernina said, hammering the cane onto the floor of the stairs. Causing a painting the shake along the wall, causing a ruckus. &quot;If you don't, it's dishes in the morning.</p>
<p>There has got to be more to life, than this Fina thought. She stared as her mother slowly walking up the stairs. “Now now, chop chop.” Their mother slammed the cane into the wall. They jump what seemed like five feet in the air. They hustled to the kitchen sink, as if to go through the motions to clean the dishes.</p>
<p>Yes, there has got to be more to life than this.</p>
<p>That Fina thought.</p>
