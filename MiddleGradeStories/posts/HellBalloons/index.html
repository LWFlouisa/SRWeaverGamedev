      <h2>Hell Balloons</h2>
<p>Fairy warped into the living world, to grant a calling wish, though there was no wishing well. “So what wish is it going to be?” said the fairy, holding a magic wand, lifting up the children with it keeping them from touching the ground. “I don’t have all day, tell me or you will keep walking.”</p>
<p>But two children were staring at the fairy dumbfounded, and were at first unsure of how to answer her question. “We would like to have a faster way to the carnival,” said one of the girls, struggling to keep her face above the dirt. “We have walked along way, and we need a place to stay.”</p>
<p>She stared at the girls with a smile. “Very well, your wish is my command.” she said, then lifted the balloons up into the sky. “Now I will be off, enjoy the fare.” And the she warped from wherever she came from.</p>
<p>For the children that wanted funnel cakes, this was the break from a long walk from forever. And then as they were flying through the sky ... “Do you know where we are going?” said the other girl, who was struggling not to lose her grip on the balloon.</p>
<p>“No, but I don’t like the feeling of this.” the main girl said. as the clouds began to warm into angry red faces with big sharp teeth. And the sky looked as if it were erupting in flames. “I don’t know where we are going all.”</p>
<p>The heat from the air, popped their balloons.</p>
<p>And then they fell and fell and fell from high in the sky down into the valley below. They landed in a deep lake, and then they swam ashore. The looked on with    horror, for mountains had faces with big sharp teeth. And stared at them like they wanted to eat their flesh and bones.</p>
<p>“I want to get out of here.” said the first girl, as she was holding onto the hand of the other. “I don’t know how you aren’t shivering.” But she wasn’t shivering, for it was very very hot. Hotter than the otherworld of the bible.</p>
<p>Eventually they came upon a small cottage, that housed a friendly old woman. Except instead of candy, it was made from living dirt that crawls into your lungs and gives you ca.cer. “What brings you, you young travelers.” said the old woman, stirring her pot of trouble.</p>
<p>The woman chased after them, with her giant spork. “I don’t like the feeling of this place.” one of the girls said.</p>
<p>“Gee you think?”</p>
<p>Then they walked and walked into the vally of the otherworld, into they found a portal. They came across a giant angry red dog, although this dog only had one head -- it tried to spray acid at them. But they managed to dodge, and then warped through the portal.</p>
<p>As much as they did not like the walk into forever, they were alive. And then arrived at the carnival to play some games for funnel cakes. Their mother was with their little brother. She saw them coming, as she entertained him as he watched the juggling clown.</p>
<p>“Where have you two been?” she said, gazing at them ominously and sniffing.</p>
<p>“It would be to hard to explain.” said the first girls, keeping a step back.</p>
<p>“Try it, and you might be surprised.”</p>
<p>“Were we dreaming?” said the other girl.</p>
<p>“Maybe, I hope so.” said the first.</p>
<p>The fairy again was taking a wish from a man who wanted something to drink at the fare. For the man had gone without water for the whole morning, as was ready for something to drink. “So what’s the wish going to be then?”</p>
<p>“I want to have a glass that will never empty?” said the thirsty man. The fairy was not sure what would happen if she gave a mortal a glass that would never empty. Never ever ever. So in that respect she was extremely curious to find out.</p>
<p>“Your wish is my command.” said the fairy, waving her wand and warped in a glass of never ending water. “But remember not to accidently tip the the glass. This is an untested experiment.</p>
<p>And then she warped out.</p>
<p>Afterward he was walking through the fare, when the two girls from earlier were chasing after each other playing at the fare. One of them accidently ran into the man. Causing him to loosen the grip on his glass. He managed to balance it, on his finger tip.</p>
<p>But the wind blew the glass. “God darn it you kids, you realize what you have done!” And the water from the glass started to cause floods after floods at the carnival. So much was pouring that there was a giant rainbow.</p>
<p>Many of the children were swimming and swimming in the carnival, and many did not know how to swim very well. So their parents had to carry them. Meanwhile in the otherworld, the fairy girl was just having a laugh, looking at the stupid humans with awe. “You did what, gave a mortal a never ending glass? You have doomed you and me.”</p>
<p>In the mortal realm. The man finally was able to swim through the large flood and retrieve his glass. He was about to drop it again, when the fairy warped it out of existence.</p>
<p>“Sorry man bad experiment,” she winked at him, “I want my head as much as you want your breath.”</p>
<p>And then she warped out.</p>
<p>Back at the castle, the fairy was having her arms held -- with her neck leaning on a chopping block. Her vision could see a hell fire basket. “I didn’t mean it, let me go -- I’ll do clean up duty I promise.” the fairy said.</p>
<p>The axe was lowered to her neck.</p>
<p>Then it was raised up.</p>
<p>Her sister cried from the sound of a basket shake, and knew that she was next. So she warped into the living world -- making sure to avoid the fairy guards that were probably looking for her.</p>
<p>And then she landed, placing her wooden shoe down upon the dirt roadway into the valley the shined in the sunset. She walked and walked and walked until eventually she found a small cottage. It was made from wattle and daub.</p>
<p>She hid her wings.</p>
<p>And knocked on the door.</p>
<p>“They still haven’t found the source of the flood” said the old man, smoking his pipe by the fireplace. The two sisters looked at the girl, and thought she looked awfully similar to the young blond fairy woman that they had met before at the fare.</p>
<p>“Pssst, what’s her deal?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know, dad just let her in.” The second sister did not see her come in. Both of them looked at her wearily, and then made their way to bed. The fairy girl would sleep with them in their room. The parents prepared a small cot.</p>
<p>“So what’s your name?”</p>
<p>“And where did you come from?”</p>
<p>“Between you and me, no here --”</p>
<p>“I knew it.”</p>
<p>“But why here?”</p>
<p>“I’m on the run.”</p>
<p>“From who?”</p>
<p>“Those guards.” And then the fairy girl became silent, picturing in her mind the fairy keeping her sister in prison forever and ever having her decapitated every day to pay for the many gallons of infinite water that were lost from the infinite glass.
 
In her mind she wished, that the glass was filled with poison.</p>
<p>And the queen would drink it.</p>
<p>That would be nice.</p>
<p>She hummed to herself:</p>
<p>Once upon a night of spring,<br />
May the clock run backwards,<br />
Clock shall lose it’s springs.<br />
In the world of human beings.</p>
<p>A world of cravings,<br />
Of many things.</p>
<p>But she had no idea, that she unintentionally cursed the humans that gave her shelter. And many many things were about to change for the fairy that came from the otherworld, where clouds and mountains were alive, growling with sharp teeth.</p>
<p>It was not the curse that made her leave, but the soiund of footsteps beating ... in the dark.</p>
<p>The humans never saw her again.</p>
